# These control how and where the cloudformation is executed
StackName: PREFIX-ENV-COMPANY-customization
OnFailure: DO_NOTHING # accepts DO_NOTHING, ROLLBACK, DELETE
Region: us-west-2
TimeOut: 15m

# Paramaters:
# There are two kinds of parameters, regular and sourced.
# Regular parameters are static and defined in the Parameters: section of this yaml file
# Sourced are parameters that cfnDeploy will go and fetch from other Stacks.
# This simple Serverless app does not depend on any other stacks. However if we start using VPC based
# Lambdas, or have multiple stacks that need to interact, we will want to use Sourced Parameters

###########
# Parameters to the cloudformation stack that are defined manually.
###########
Parameters:

  # Memory footprint for Lambdas processing lots of resources
  pLargeLambdaSize: 768

  # Default name of the AssumeRole to assume into accounts

  pSmallLambdaSize: 128

###########
# These stacks are needed by the SourcedParameters section
###########
